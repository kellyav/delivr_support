 ## Scenarios
 
 - **cust_revenue.sql**
 
 A customer just called Delivr's Customer Support team; she wants to double-check whether her receipts add up. Going by her receipts, she calculated that her total bill on Delivr is $271, and she wants to make sure of that.
 
 - **rev_per_week.sql**
 
 Delivr's first full month of operations was June 2018. At launch, the Marketing team ran an ad campaign on popular food channels on TV, with the number of ads increasing each week through the end of the month. The Head of Marketing asks you to help her assess that campaign's success.
