 ## Scenarios
 
 - **cust_revenue.sql**
 
 A customer just called Delivr's Customer Support team; she wants to double-check whether her receipts add up. Going by her receipts, she calculated that her total bill on Delivr is $271, and she wants to make sure of that.
 
 - **rev_per_week.sql**
 
Delivr's first full month of operations was June 2018. See the revenue per week for each week
in their first month, and check whether there's any consistent growth in revenue.
